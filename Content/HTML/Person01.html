        <h2>Background & Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in a small town, where my fascination with technology began when I received an old computer at age 12. I spent hours learning to troubleshoot and upgrade it, and by high school, I was already helping classmates with their tech issues. I pursued a degree in Information Technology, focusing on software development and networking, and interned at tech companies working on cloud computing and network security. Now, with my degree, I’m excited to start my career in cybersecurity, focusing on protecting digital infrastructures.

        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and experimenting with DIY electronics projects. I’m a big fan of gaming, especially strategy games, which help me think critically and improve my problem-solving skills. I also love hiking and being outdoors, as it helps me unwind after long coding sessions. When it comes to reading, I enjoy both fiction and non-fiction, particularly books on technology, self-improvement, and sci-fi novels that inspire creativity.
