            My passion for technology began in high school, where I taught myself programming languages and built web applications. I went on to study Software Engineering, focusing on full-stack development and cloud computing. During my internships, I worked at a startup on scalable cloud applications, learning the importance of teamwork and clean code. Now that I’ve graduated, I’m eager to start my career as a software engineer, focusing on building cloud-based solutions that drive innovation.

            I’m an avid runner and participate in local marathons, which helps me stay focused and disciplined. I also enjoy playing video games, especially those that require strategic thinking and teamwork, like multiplayer online games. Reading is another passion of mine, particularly books on philosophy and technology. I find that philosophy helps me think critically, while books about software development keep me sharp in my technical skills. Additionally, I love tinkering with electronics and building small projects in my spare time.
