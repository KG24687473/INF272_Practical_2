            Growing up in a multicultural environment, I was always drawn to technology and programming. In high school, I joined the robotics club and competed in regional tech competitions, sparking my interest in artificial intelligence. I pursued a degree in Information Technology, specializing in AI and machine learning. Through internships and research projects, I gained hands-on experience in AI-driven data analytics, and after graduation, I plan to work in AI development to help create innovative solutions for complex problems.

            When I’m not coding, I’m often spending my time playing basketball with my friends. It’s a great way for me to stay active and improve my teamwork and leadership skills. I also love listening to podcasts on technology, entrepreneurship, and science fiction. In terms of reading, I’m really into books on AI and machine learning, as well as classic science fiction novels that delve into the future of technology and its impact on society.
