            <img src="../HTML/Images/antman-and-the-wasp-marvel-4.jpeg" alt="Person's Photo">
            From a young age, I was fascinated by how computers work, often helping my father, an IT professional, troubleshoot gadgets at home. In high school, I joined the computer science club and built my first website at 15, which led me to pursue a degree in Information Technology with a focus on web development and UX/UI design. I’ve interned with design agencies to create user-friendly websites, and I’m now looking forward to a career as a UX/UI designer, crafting intuitive, accessible digital experiences.

            Outside of my studies, I have a love for painting and digital art, which allows me to express my creativity in ways that complement my tech skills. I also enjoy hiking and exploring new places, as it helps me recharge and get new ideas for my design work. In terms of reading, I’m a huge fan of graphic novels, fantasy books, and anything related to design and user experience. I also like to participate in local tech meetups and hackathons, where I can connect with others who share my interests in tech and innovation.
